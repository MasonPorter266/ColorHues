        <h2>Color Spectrum</h2>
        <h3>The color spectrum is made up of all visible colors (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Purple). On the electromagnetic spectrum visible light falls between 380nm to 750nm. The color spectrum is created from white light which is the a combination of all colors which is why when you break white light up you get ROYGBIV.</h3>

        <h2>Color</h2>
        <h3>Color is the characteristic of human visual perception described through color categories, with names such as red, yellow, purple, or blue. This perception of color derives from the stimulation of cone cells in the human eye by electromagnetic radiation in the spectrum of light. Color categories and physical specifications of color are associated with objects through the wavelength of the light that is reflected from them. This reflection is governed by the object's physical properties such as light absorption, emission spectra, etc. </h3>
        <h3>So why are somethings blue and other red? Well that is because as all colors hit an object certain rays of light are absorbed causing them to not be visible. The color that reflects is what we see. What about white and black? For use to see white all colors must be reflected and for use to see black all colors must be absorbed.</h3>
        <h2>RGB</h2>
        <h3>You can make almost any color with just Red, Green, and Blue. This is why they are called additive colors.</h3>
        <h2>Elements of Color</h2>
        <h3>There are three elements of color. They are Hue (color), Value (Brightness), and Chroma (Brilliance).</h3>
        <h3>Hue denotes qualities that can be differentiated by color words such as red, yellow, green, blue or purple. These properties we describe as hues are not independent entities in themselves but form part of a color continuum which, like a ring, has no beginning and no end but forms a seamless continuum. Between red and yellow there is an infinite number of colors possessing the elements of both these colors.</h3>
        <h3>Value describes the relative brightness of colors. As well as differentiating colors by their hues, we can express them as brighter or darker. Bright colors are crisp and refreshing, giving a pleasant, cheerful impression. Dark colors are heavy and subdued. This is the dimension of color "weighting."</h3>
        <h3>Chroma differentiates color by their brilliance or strength. The brilliance or dullness of colors can be expressed in quantitative terms on the basis of chroma (C). A brilliant color stands out and strikes us as gorgeous. A dull color creates a quiet, subdued impression, the image we frequently associate with gentler, more refined colors. This is the dimension of color brilliance.</h3>

            <h1>Hexadecimal</h1>
            <h2>Information</h2>
            <h3>In mathematics and computing, hexadecimal (also base 16, or hex) is a positional numeral system with a radix, or base, of 16. It uses sixteen distinct symbols, most often the symbols 0–9 to represent values zero to nine, and A, B, C, D, E, F (or alternatively a, b, c, d, e, f) to represent values ten to fifteen.</h3>
            <h3>Hexadecimal numerals are widely used by computer system designers and programmers. As each hexadecimal digit represents four binary digits (bits), it allows a more human-friendly representation of binary-coded values. One hexadecimal digit represents a nibble (4 bits), which is half of an octet or byte (8 bits). For example, a single byte can have values ranging from 00000000 to 11111111 in binary form, but this may be more conveniently represented as 00 to FF in hexadecimal.</h3>
